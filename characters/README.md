slybollie:
level 1->2= 1225
level 60 hp= 82,075
lvl60hp-lvl1hp / 1225=59
each level 1225
so i guess just max level hp minus level 1 hp divided by max level-1
level 4 hp is 13475 (9800+1225+1225+1225)
seems to work unless new rangers are different

LCMS:
if you're maxing a ranger on exp 2x days then the UL is enough to cover the 5 level gain so 140-145-150... but from 190-195 you need the UL + one 6* ranger then for 195-200 it's UL + two 6* rangers and so on
```

### max level by \*'s

```
1: 20 -> 40
2: 30 -> 50
3: 40 -> 60
4: 50 -> 70 (hyper/ultimate 170 & LP 100)
5: 60 -> 80 (hyper/ultimate 180 & LP 100)
6: 80 -> 100 (hyper/ultimate 200 & LP 100)
