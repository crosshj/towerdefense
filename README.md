I'm making a game and starting with Line Rangers style.

### Development Tools

-   characters: http://127.0.0.1:8000/characters/test/index.html
-   main stage map: http://127.0.0.1:8000/pages/stage/main/backgroundTool.html
-   audio: http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/audio.html
-   experience: http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/experience.html
-   render: http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/render.html
-   assets: http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/assets.html
-   sprites: http://127.0.0.1:8000/characters/test/sprites/index.html

### What I like about LR:

-   visuals (except would prefer less cute)
-   gameplay

### What I dislike about LR:

-   money-grabbing
-   disconnected from community/players
-   gacha that feels unfair (and if it really is unfair then see a host of other
    endorphin-based predatory games)
-   not enough open-ness / nerd / API (this is why lerico exists to document
    line)
-   in-game communication sucks (this is why people use discord?)

from lerico, characters seem to be under 200x200 with many around 170 high and
varying widths 760x428 game dims from a screencap I saw, seems reasonable

heights zoomed in total - 400/1400(28.5%) (above tower) + 650/1400(46.4%)
(tower - including shadow of 50px) + 350/1400(25%) (below tower) horizon line at
800/1400 from top character - about 350/1400 (25%)

new res 800 x 4000 tower top - 229px from top tower - 371px (with 28px shadow)
tower bottom - 600px from top

character - 200px
