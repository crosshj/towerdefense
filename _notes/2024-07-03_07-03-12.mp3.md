### Transcript

I'm going to look at this game that I've been making and just talk about it. The
hope would be that I could just talk about it and something would write this
down for me and understand what it is that I'm trying to prioritize, but I'll
just talk about it anyways.

The idea is to clone enough about Line Rangers to achieve some kind of parity.
Once I get to that parity spot, I'll start making significant changes, pretty
much just like fork and then start slicing and dicing. When I get to a point
where I feel like I've changed it enough to be recognizable as its own thing,
I'll start sharing that with people.

Whenever I open the app, I get a main stage that greets me with a spot for five
characters, lots of menu items around, and a scrollable background showing
different stages and sections like Lab, Guild, Raid, Special Stage, PvP, Arena,
and Tower.

There's an AI-generated background that talks about the controls. The controls
indicate user icon, experience, booster, news, and what characters are currently
buffed for the week, month, or year. It also shows the resources: feathers,
gems, coins, and friend points. It also offers another thing to the right that
shows a quest, like a monthly quest that the user can interact with to achieve
rewards over time.

The core action buttons down at the bottom are seven, or eight if you count the
settings sub-icon. Everything I mentioned at this point pretty much works;
there's something there that you can click on, and it takes you somewhere.
Whether or not that somewhere is completed is another thing, but all the clicks
are wired up for everything mentioned up to this point. The buttons I'm about to
talk about are no exception. There's at least a button that you can click on. It
may not look like what it's supposed to look like, but it indicates what's going
on here.

For those, it's my team, which is similar to the five slots that are showing on
the main screen, except it gives you a means of editing those teams or editing
the team that you can see there plus more. It also gives you a jump-off point to
characters that you've collected, maybe sell them, combine them with other
Rangers, and that kind of thing. That screen is mostly hooked up in the sense
that it's there and you can scroll a fake list of characters that have been
achieved. You can't sort those, and the ability to place those into teams and
actually save it is fairly limited. In fact, you can't save it at all.

I've worked out the system for whenever you go into these other pages; there
will be a label at the top and you should be able to click an icon. I've also
worked out the system that shows different kinds of resources depending on which
screen you go to. I spent the last part of my development on that. From the main
screen, there's also the upgrade, which lets you upgrade your user-related
statistics according to your level or abilities. Things like upgrading how fast
mineral increases and what's the maximum mineral you can get from level 1 to 99.
You can also upgrade missile power, tower HP, and mineral gain. All these things
become available depending on the level that you're operating on. Itâ€™s a perk
for leveling up. You can now, as a reward, level up certain aspects of your
user-related power. This screen is mostly in place. The key portion is that you
can scroll left and right and hit a button that allows you to upgrade the
functionality. Similar to other things I've mentioned, it is not really
connected.

Back to the main screen, there's the collection screen which shows all of the
in-game units that you've seen or collected. You get a reward for seeing new
units or upgrading units to a point where they show up in your collection, and
those rewards are in gems. I don't have any of that hooked up, but I've got the
basics of the screen there. There's a background. You should be able to switch
between units and special. I think special would be like enemies that you've
seen that you can't collect yourself, but being able to see them comes with
rewards as well. I can't remember exactly, but I think so. As you explore later
levels in the game, you're able to get rewards for seeing those.

Back to the main screen, there's a shop. Right now the shop just has a
background and a means to change between four different sections: Ruby, feather,
coin package. These are linked to whenever you click on the resource buttons up
at the top of most of the screens. You come to the shop to purchase more rubies,
more feathers, and more coins. The package would be like you get several of
those together or whatever. I've also worked out the idea of whenever there's
something offered here, how that links out to another page and asks for money
from people. I haven't fully gone too far with that, but that much is in place.

Back to the main screen, there's a friends list. You should be able to help the
friends that you've made, and you should be able to add and invite new friends.
This is important to the viralness of the app. You want friends to be something
that people are pushing for, you know, "Hey, come try this game out," and
reasonably geared up for that particular part.

Back to the main screen, there's a thing called pass, and that's essentially
mission and pass. This is similar to the quest thing in the sense that there
will be daily specials or things that you get a reward for, and it's pushing you
to do particular things on a daily or weekly basis. I don't know what special
stands for, but I think there may be some link between this and the quest. I
haven't played the game in a while, so I'm not interested in digging too far
into it right now.

Back to the main screen, there's a gift box. The gift box is where you accept
friendship points that were sent to you or whatever, and maybe gifts that were
sent to you based on your performance over the last month or whatever. There are
different reasons why you get gifts. Some of these screens that I was talking
about before are basically pages; other screens are modals. I don't know what
the rule for this would be because I haven't dug that deeply into it, but I have
provided a means for some of these to be modals the way that Line Rangers does,
and some of them will be actual screens that you go to. The gift box was one of
the first that functions as a modal. The things that I talked about before for
experience, level, user icon, profile settings, news, buff, and quest all pop up
on top of whatever screen you're at.

The interaction with that, I feel like in some cases I try to click on the close
button and the close button doesn't work. I have to improve that interaction a
little bit. But over time, that will happen.

I'm going to talk about the settings icon, a small icon that is there for
setting things like background music, sound effects, languages, different
notifications you have, and certain account information. I have that mostly in
place. Each of the tabs works and shows a button, but I don't have anything
connected except for background music and sound effects. I'm able to turn those
off, which is nice because I'm not the kind of player that generally plays with
music or sound effects. But it's nice to know that at least for some time, it'll
be there. Who knows how many people will use it?

Based on everything I've said, I think the big thing to focus on next is team
setup. Like a dummy list of all the characters available. We're not going to
determine whether or not this particular user has all the characters. We're just
going to make all the characters available, and you should be able to go to my
team and assign users to that team and save that. That's going to play a big
part in actually building the game out. On the home screen, you should be able
to see all those characters. That would be a primary feature of the home screen.
When you go to the main stage, it shows you a map. You're able to click on one
of the worlds there. You should be able to select your team from there. Not
customize your team, but you should be able to select it. Maybe there is some
customization, but the point is you should be able to set up the game that
you're about to play. One of the things you do for that is select the team that
you're working on. I've built the screen out, but I don't have a way to pull
back what team you're using or what characters belong on that. It's obvious that
one of the most important things to this point is just being able to build a
team.

When you go to the next screen, you should be able to select a friend. I'm not
terribly interested in building that one out yet because I haven't really dug
into the friend thing, and I don't think having a friend is the key feature of
the game at this point. But you can hit start and have a game play. Right now
the game is hard-coded to use whatever team is in the definition of the game,
but that's very basic in the sense that the user can't really play the game
without having the ability to use their characters. The next step in playing the
game would be to have the characters that the user actually owns be the
characters that they play the game with.

The game itself was one of the first things I focused on. And what I mean by
that is just being able to load up a stage, scroll left and right, and determine
whether a win happened versus a loss. Even though the game is connected, the
game that you're playing with is just a dummy game that was set up, and it
doesn't have the characters that you own and that you've been upgrading and
leveling up. So the next obvious choice after I've got all the main menus set up
in the game is to focus on the section where you're able to set your team up.
That's what I'm going to be doing. I just wanted a chance to walk through and
talk through this. I

would love if there was an AI connected to this that would go through and parse
what I've written down or talked about and sort of write it down and keep it as
notes next to the code base for this, but I don't have that right now. Maybe
I'll get it in the future, but for now, it'll just be a recording.

I'm not going to talk about what comes next after the team. I think what comes
next after the team is getting the outcome of whatever game was played, any
rewards that were given, did you lose, did you win, did you get any characters,
did you get coins? I think I can do a little bit to establish that portion of
it. To have anything real, I have to have the notion of an actual user. Being
able to set up a particular game for running implies, well, at this point it
implies that I've faked the usable characters that someone has. Probably the
next step is really focusing on the user and getting the user in the database or
even local. It's probably getting the team closer to being set up with the
notion that the user is being faked. Once the team is set up, then getting the
rewards added to the user is something I can set up, but without a user, it
doesn't really make any sense. So maybe the user is the next thing for me to
work on.
